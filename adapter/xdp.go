// depends on which interface the filter is attached to, and a LAN client
// torrenting through a proxy inbound is a legitimate target. It only rejects
// endpoints that cannot identify a remote peer at all — a loopback endpoint
// means the "peer" is a local shim (the masque-wg / wdtt relays feed plain
// WireGuard to their endpoints over 127.0.0.1), so banning it would take out
// the relay rather than the offender. //H
